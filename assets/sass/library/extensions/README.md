# Extensions

Basically, there are two kinds of *extensions* that can be used by Sass/Compass:

- RubyGems;
- Ad-hoc Compass extensions.

The first is pretty straight forward for Ruby users: you can install the gems by running `gem install` and have them available to import on your files by requiring them at your *config.rb*.

The second is something purely managed by Compass, and we will have a look at it below.


### Installing gem available extensions

The extensions that are available as gems should be added to the *Gemfile* at the root directory and then required in the *config.rb*. Adding to the *Gemfile* makes sure anyone contributing to your project later will match all dependencies by running `bundler install`.

Please, if you don't know Bundler dependency manager (and I have to say I didn't, before having to write this documentation) have a look at it's documentation and installation instructions at [bundler.io](http://bundler.io/).


### Installing Ad-hoc extensions

Ad-hoc extensions are at last the ones that should reside in the *extensions* directory (here). They are something Compass understand, and because of that Compass will simply lookup this directory and load the extensions automatically, so all you have to do is `@import` them in your *sass* files.

If an `@import` statement for a vendor extension should generate CSS (e.g. [normalize](https://github.com/ksmandersen/compass-normalize)), you should write this import clause in a [source](../source) file to avoid breaking the non-emitting concept of the library. If it is something that does not emit CSS (e.g. [Susy](https://github.com/ericam/susy)) you might want to import and configure it at the *[extensions.sass](../library/settings/extensions.sass)* file, for this way all partials can benefit from the extension.

**This kind of extension, as I said, don't have to be explicitly required in the *config.rb***.


## About Sache

Finding good Sass/Compass extensions was once a hard job. Not anymore. Now you can easily discover new ones visiting [Sache](http://www.sache.in), an amazing Sass project listing tool! Even [SassySkeleton](http://www.sache.in/search?query=skeleton) is there to greet the crowd!


## Further reading

There are some articles about extending Sass/Compass that you might like to follow. Here is a small list of the ones I read to prepare this documentation:

- [Managing Compass Extensions with Bundler](http://atendesigngroup.com/blog/managing-compass-extensions-bundler);
- [Compass Extensions](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/extensions/);
- [Compass Extensions are Easy](http://chriseppstein.github.io/blog/2010/10/21/compass-extensions-are-easy/).


### Bower is lovely

I find Bower the best package manager for the web, and I simply love the way it handles dependencies. If you are like me and would like to find a way to use Bower as a extensions manager for this skeleton, you're welcome to read the following articles and try what best suits your use case:

- [Bower all the things](https://www.codefellows.org/blogs/bower-all-the-things);
- [Using Bower with Compass](https://coderwall.com/p/bhb0pq).
