# Sprites

This directory should contain a sub-directory for each sprite map you would like to have. Also, you will need to add the sprite includes to the [library/settings/sprites.sass](../library/settings/sprites.sass) partial.

Compass spriting has a pretty good [official documentation](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/), so I don't think I need to dive much deeper in details on how to setup everything here.

You should, however, have a good look at the [library/settings/sprites.sass](../library/settings/sprites.sass) partial, as it contains an extended documentation on how I planed sprites for this skeleton. Basically, there is [hole issue](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/issues/1005) about Compass always emitting CSS when importing sprites, and that is pretty much explained and resolved in the file mentioned above.
